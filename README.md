# Decompression_Compression_Algorithm--Winzip_Alternative

_****Overview****_

This project implements a compression and decompression algorithm as an alternative to Winzip. The algorithm is based on Huffman coding, a widely used method for lossless data compression.
It provides a Python implementation of both compression and decompression processes.

_**Introduction**_
The project consists of two main components: compression and decompression.

**_Usage_**
**Compression**:

To compress a file, you can use the compress_file function provided in the Python script. Here's how to use it:
_python decompress.py input_file.compressed output_file.txt_
Replace input_file.txt with the path to the file you want to compress and output_file.compressed with the desired name for the compressed output file.

**_Decompression_**

To decompress a file, you can use the decompress_file function provided in the Python script. Here's how to use it:
_python decompress.py input_file.compressed output_file.txt_

Replace input_file.compressed with the path to the compressed input file and output_file.txt with the desired name for the decompressed output file.
